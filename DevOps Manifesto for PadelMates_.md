DevOps Manifesto for PadelMates:

Values:

1. Culture: People First - The culture of PadelMates is centered around putting people first. This means that the company prioritizes the well-being and growth of its employees over profits or efficiency. This fosters a positive and supportive work environment that promotes innovation and creativity.
1. Automation: Main - Automation is a crucial component of the DevOps philosophy. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, teams can free up time to focus on more strategic initiatives. This allows for faster and more efficient software development, testing, and deployment.

Tool Suggestions :




Configuration Management

`	 `Ansible, Chef, Puppet


`	`Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

`	`Terraform, CloudFormation


`	`Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

`	`Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, Github actions or hosting services own CI/CD

`	`Containerization

`	 `Docker, Kubernetes, EKS, ECS


`	`Test Automation:

`	`Currently Padelmates is doing manual testing but Padelmates needs to go for Selenium, Appium, JMeter, CircleCI alike tools


`	`Monitoring and Logging

`	`Sentry and Datadog are the current tools that have been used by padelmates. But Padelmates, can go for open source tools like  : Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)





1. Measurement: Mean Time to Recover, Life Cycle, Cost, Revenue, Employee Satisfaction - Measuring performance is essential for continuous improvement. PadelMates tracks metrics such as mean time to recover, product life cycle, cost, revenue, and employee satisfaction to monitor the effectiveness of its DevOps practices.


Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)


`	`To track MTTR, tools such as PagerDuty, VictorOps, and OpsGenie can be used to quickly notify DevOps teams about incidents and track incident resolution times.

`	`Product Life Cycle

`	`To track the product life cycle and to track the progress of product development and deployment., Padelmates is using Jira,

`	`Cost and Revenue


`	`is being tracked manually.

`	`Employee Satisfaction


`	`To track employee satisfaction, tools such as Officevibe, TinyPulse, and 15Five can be used to conduct employee surveys, track employee feedback, and monitor employee engagement.




1. Sharing: Ideas, Problems, Openness & Transparency - Collaboration and communication are essential for effective DevOps. PadelMates encourages the sharing of ideas, problems, and feedback to foster a culture of openness and transparency.






Principles:(Needs to be practiced)


1. Systems Thinking: Overall Outcome, System Design - Systems thinking is the process of understanding how different components of a system interact to achieve an overall outcome. PadelMates prioritizes system design to ensure that all components work together efficiently and effectively.
1. Amplify Feedback Loop: Shorten the Loop - By shortening the feedback loop, PadelMates can quickly identify and address issues in the development and deployment process. This promotes continuous improvement and faster delivery of high-quality software. Padelmates is using Jira, Teams for communication and feedback. The support teams report to the dev teams and dev teams take action.

Process :  Design - Dev - Test - Prod - User - Support  to Dev - Test - Prod - User

To shorten the feedback loop, Padelmates is planning to fix the issue in the dev rather than       going to the support team

1. PadelMates follows a continuous cycle of software development, testing, deployment, user feedback, and support to ensure that the product is always improving and meeting user needs.

Methodologies:(Needs to be practiced)

1. People over Process and Tool - While tools and processes are essential, PadelMates believes that people are the most critical factor in the DevOps process. Empowering and supporting employees leads to more successful outcomes.
1. Continuous Delivery: Smaller Releases - Continuous delivery is the practice of continuously releasing small updates to the software, rather than waiting for a large release. This approach leads to faster feedback and enables teams to quickly address issues.
1. Lean Management: Work in Small Batches, Work in Progress Limit, Feedback Loops, Visualization - Lean management is a philosophy that prioritizes reducing waste and improving efficiency. PadelMates follows this philosophy by working in small batches, setting work in progress limits, using feedback loops, and visualizing the development process.
1. Change Control, Visible Ops - Change control is the process of managing changes to software systems to ensure that they are controlled, predictable, and meet quality standards. PadelMates needs to use visible ops to make sure that changes are visible to everyone involved in the process.

Proper documentation of the systems and architecture needs to be done, code documentation needs to be done properly. Right now, datadog and sentry are being used for monitoring, logging purposes which is a good practice.

1. Infrastructure as Code, System should be treated Like Code. Test, Review, Release - Infrastructure as code is the practice of managing infrastructure through code, which makes it more efficient and easier to manage. PadelMates treats its system like code, testing, reviewing, and releasing it like any other software product.

Success Techniques:(Needs to be practiced)

1. Incident Command System - The incident command system is a structured approach to managing emergency situations. PadelMates needs this approach to quickly and effectively manage any issues that arise in the development or deployment process.
1. Developer on Call - Having developers on call ensures that there is always someone available to address any issues that arise, even outside of regular working hours.
1. Status Page in Case of Failure - Having a status page that communicates any issues to users quickly and clearly is essential


ChatOps:

Use ChatOps to manage the DevOps process. ChatOps is a collaboration model that connects people, tools, processes, and automation into a transparent workflow. ChatOps enables teams to collaborate in real-time, make decisions faster, and improve overall productivity.
